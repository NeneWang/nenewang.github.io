    "In writing Python code for data science, I generally go between three modes of working: I use the IPython shell for trying out short sequences of commands, the Jupyter Notebook for longer interactive analysis and for sharing content with others, and interactive development environments (IDEs) like Emacs or VSCode for creating reusable Python packages.\n",
    "This chapter focuses on the first two modes: the IPython shell and the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "Use of an IDE for software development is an important third tool in the data scientist's repertoire, but we will not directly address that here."
