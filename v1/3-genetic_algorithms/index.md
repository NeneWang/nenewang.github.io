# Genetic Algorithms

Study Anki Cards
- https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/862684562
  - DEAP Framework
  - Common Genetic Strategies

**Backlog**
- [ ] Add All Mutation Streategies from [Medium](https://medium.com/geekculture/crossover-operators-in-ga-cffa77cdd0c8) into cards.

## Content

- [Vehicle Routing problem](./vrp)

**Must Finish**
- [ ] Constrait Satisfaction Problem (5)
- [ ] Optimizing Continuous Problem (6)
- [ ] Other Evolutionary and Bio Inspired Competition Techniques (12)

**Leave for Later**
- [ ] Enhancing Machine Learning Models using Featured Selection.

Notes
- Mainly will be using [DEAP Framework](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/tools.html#deap.tools.cxOnePoint)


### Backlog

- [ ] Traveling Salesman With Time Frame Own Implementation
- [ ] Try using Cooperative Coevolution [^coop]
- [ ] Try the Artificial [Ant Problem](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples/gp_ant.html)  

[^coop] [Cooperative Coevolution](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples/coev_coop.html?highlight=toolbox.evaluate) is a method that uses multiple populations to solve a problem. Each population is responsible for solving a part of the problem. The populations are evolved separately, and their solutions are combined to form a solution to the complete problem.
