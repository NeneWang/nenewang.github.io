## Plan and Long term outline.

I think this is a great place to communicate in a professional manner, advanced solutions and algorithms to boost my resume. Specifically when it comes to catching the atention into advanced topics in Computer Science. Imagine a great book on Computer Science that can be both used for showing your skills as well as amassing your knowledge over time. 


Remember that each of the following algorithms are to be 

Computer Science
- Genetic Algorithms
- Search Algorithms
- Constraint Sastifcation
- Graph Problems
- K Means Clustering
- Artistic Algorithms
- Recommendation Algorithms
- Algorithms Codex

* Algorithms Codex: Have all the most complex algorithms here and show in code if possible a small gif of each and how to use them. (Once you understand them)


Infrastructure
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Site Reliability Engineering
- Open Stack
- Local Stack
- Devops: Docker, etc.
- Computer ArchitectureSimulations


Software Engineering
- System Design
- Design Pattern: The 22 of them and ++
- Best Practices
- Documentation Theory
- Processes
- Testing Best Practices
- Product Management
- Telemetry
- Architecture
- Advanced Architecture
- Frameworks Cheatsheets: Reference to Flashcards, Obsidian Notes, and quick practices and solutions to learn a framework
- Database Theory


Data Science & AI
- Calculus
- Multivariable Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Mathematics
- Statistics
- Papers on AI


Game Engine - This sounds better than 
- Rendering
- Sprite Animation
- Theory
- Building a Physics Engine
- Math Engine
- Narrative
- Design Patterns for Games


Cybersecurity
- TBD *I literally have no idea how relevant this will be*



Finance Simulations
Cover here some interesting simulations that can be done in Finance (at least the most visual ones.)
- Macro economics
- Micro economics
- Accounting
- Finance
- Financial Matehmatics


Engineering
- Robotics
- Electronic Engineering
- Physics
- Statics
- Thermodynamics


## Procedures

### Principles

- This is not an notebook: For taking notes you can use Obsidian, here the idea is to have the refined documents. 
- Think of each note as a guide you would use to assist others to understand. However by taking only, the key definitions, and showing the practical part (assigments)
- Provide assigments for 


### Contributing to Jupyter Books

- [ ] Support for running the code on a simulated environment. (Literally connect to an kernel)



### Note Creation Process

The idea is to craft this over time. 

- Similar to a magician that writes books and mantains his book over time. The idea is that at least once a week. All notes should be accompnaied with:
    - Unique view point with your visualizations and gifs. 
    - Interactive Visualizations if possible. 
    - A quick link to a virtual environment where you can run this
    - Your youtube video attempting to explain this.
    - If possible all related resources such as MIT Youtube Playlists, Books, pages int he books and quotes (and a probably illegal host of this books and pages)
- You present something about something in your Youtube Channel, and link that video with this, together with some interesting equations on the topic. 
- Craft this project over time, while you continue working on perhaps some interesting company and improve your resume for both personal sastifcation, as well. 
- This is to be crafted and it is expected that multiple books will be used as reference
