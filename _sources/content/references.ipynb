    "```{example}\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A **bolded _reference_** to a page](./myst.md)\n",
    "- [A reference to a header](content:references:labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving the title empty will mean the reference uses the target as text, for example:\n",

    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Internal vs. External URLs\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "You can control how MyST Markdown distinguishes between internal references and external URLs in your `_config.yml`.\n",

    "   myst_url_schemes: [mailto, http, https]\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Check for missing references\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for missing references when building a Jupyter Book.\n",
    "To do so, use the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter-book build -W -n --keep-going docs/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will check for missing references (`-n`) and turn them into errors (`-W`),\n",
