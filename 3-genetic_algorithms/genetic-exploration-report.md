# Genetic Exploration Report

## I. Introduction

### A statement of intent 

The intention of this simulation is to explore the applications of genetic algorithms


### Background information on genetic algorithms

Background information on genetic algorithms: what they are, what their history is, how they have been used in the past, and how your work adds to or detracts from that prior use

### Relevance to biological anthropology

- The relevance of your project to biological anthropology- Note how important is with finding solutions.
- This pursuit, influenced by biology and psychology, led to the development of neural networks, machine learning, and evolutionary computation, marking significant advancements since the 1980s.
- Today we see applications of these algorithms Many like computational protein engineering and financial market prediction, require searching through vast possibilities for solutions. [^gen_ch1]
- This biological inspired solutions tend to thrive in problems which conditions are expected to change.
- Furthermore, evolution allows for parallel search, which today is augmented by the parallel processing capabilities of modern computers. [^gen_ch1]

### Origins of Gneetic ALgorithms


- Tracing back to the earliest computer scientists like Turing and von Neumann, who envisioned imbuing computer programs with intelligence, replication, and adaptive learning akin to natural systems.[^gen_ch1]
- In the 1950s and 1960s, computer scientists explored evolutionary systems for optimization, inspired by natural genetic variation and selection.[^gen_ch1]
- One of the earlies strategies that solves computer problems can be traced to John Holland in the 1975, w  aiming to study adaptation in nature and import natural adaptation mechanisms into computer systems.[^gen_ch1]
- Holland's genetic algorithm involves natural selection, crossover, mutation, and inversion operations on a population of chromosomes (that can be represented as 1 or 0s).[^gen_ch1]
- Holland's work is used today as the backbone of genetic algorithms, which are used to solve/inspire solutions for optimization problems, machine learning, and neural networks.[^gen_ch1]

### Cultural Anthropology:

- In this report I will attempt to connect how genetic algorithms can be used to represent behaviours in cultural anthropology.
- Develop interactive visualizations to solve the Knapsack Problem using various Genetic algorithms, simulating different societal mating structures with selection methods like Elitism, Rank Selection and mutations.
- Create interactive simulations illustrating how behavioral strategies, such as Aggressive and Non-aggressive, affect reproductive fitness through Game Theory and allele distribution across generations.
- Develop interactive visualizations or simulations to enhance the course curriculum, aiding instructors in creating related homework assignments.


### Biological and Computing Terminology
*Geneeral Interpretation of methods. To understand the termonologies we have to first examine how the methods work.*

### II. Method(s)

- 


## The Knapsack Problem

- [ ] Add the link for the simulator

- This Problem is useful to start illustrating how genetic algorithms work.
- The Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to maximize the value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
- Here I will post some hypothesis and results of the simulations that can be explored here.




- How did you create/finalize your algorithms?
- How did you determine the various settings and selection methods?

### III. Results

- Describe the results, including how to read the graph/chart data
- Are the results consistent with expectation or variant?
- How are the results applicable? What is the value of the overall project?
