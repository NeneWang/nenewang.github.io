### Algorithms

https://github.com/NeneWang/graph-algo-exploration

Plan
- Add all the algorithms relevant agorithm form the book (Pseudocode)
- Add them also in LTS support Anki
- Set to study all the algorithms that are related to Grpah.
- For the session in Codepath Do the same (The idea is to not have to many ugly subsectiosn but link them togehter. Same goes for Math: calculust, linear algebra, etc. should be on the same folder to avoid cluttering the main page)
